An assignment on Neural Machine Translation 

REPROLANG and reproducibility </br>

Assignment : a replication study  </br>
deliverables: </br>
1- the docker with the system and the code </br>
2- A two-page paper summarizing your work: </br>

### EXPECTED OUTLINE OF YOUR PAPER  </br>
state of the art (just summarise the original paper section )</br>
summary of the original study </br>
data processing </br>
(Describe the dataset used in the paper. For French what would you need to do to run the data? Detail the annotation (Pos-tagging with Treetagger, parsing with StanfordCoreNLP??).</br>
results </br>
issues </br>
discussion </br>
conclusion </br>
acknowledgement: be explicit about how you split the work, say who did what</br>

THERE WILL BE NO DEADLINE EXTENSION


Send me your PDF files to nicolas.ballier AT u-paris.fr , our two moodle are not yet compatible.
Do not forget to include your Docker instructions. If you need to resort to a virtial machine (like Vagrant), send me a link to a transfer solution. 

If your system does not work, document the programming limitations, the conflicting libraries or any problems you faced. if you began recoding explain wat went wrong and what functions you could not translate. If you're running out of time to train the data, try to train 1/10 of the data and document the required time. The analogy is that for a company you would document the extra time/budget you would need to finish the project.
