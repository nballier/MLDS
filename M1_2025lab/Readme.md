# ASSIGNMENT:

Retrain Treetagger with a specific tagset that distinguishes the different uses of *that*. Report precision and recall with the specific datasets.

### C8 tagset [adapted]:(https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws8tags.pdf)   <br/>
WPR relative pronoun, "that"  <br/>
CST "that" (as conjunction for nouns, as in *the fact that*). Note that this tag in C7 subsumed both “that” as a complementizer and “that” as a relativizer  <br/>
CJT "that" as a conjunction for verbs (I think that you are right)    <br/>
DT singular determiner (e.g. "this", "that", "another")  <br/>
RB adverb  (it's not that difficult)   <br/>
