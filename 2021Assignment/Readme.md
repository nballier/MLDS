# 2021 ASSIGNMENTS


Some of the tasks are taken from the REPROLANG 2020 workshop: Shared Task on the Reproduction of Research Results in Science and Technology of Language
Collocated with LREC 2020 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference.
<https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/reprolang2020/>



## Deadline = Feb 28th midnight

## Requirements
Your data and code should be encapsulated in a docker:
