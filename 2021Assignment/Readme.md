# 2021 ASSIGNMENTS


Some of the tasks are taken from the REPROLANG 2020 workshop: Shared Task on the Reproduction of Research Results in Science and Technology of Language
Collocated with LREC 2020 12th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference. \
<https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/reprolang2020/>



## Deadline = Feb 28th midnight
Assignment : a replication study \
1- the docker with the system and the code \
2- A two-page paper summarizing your work. 

## Requirements
Your data and code should be encapsulated in a docker: \
<https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/reprolang2020/submission/>

Your assignment must respect the requirements of a research paper (introduction, state of the art, presentation of your results, discussion and a reference section), following a given paper template \
<https://lrec2020.lrec-conf.org/en/submission2020/authors-kit/> .   
**SUGGESTED OUTLINE** \
state of the art \
summary of the replicated study  \
results  \
issues \
discussion  \
conclusion  \
acknowledgement: be explicit about how you split the work between members of the team  \
